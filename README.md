# BullsEyeClickingGame
JavaFX game where the player clicks on a bullseye and collects points on each click.

## Eclipse Setup
* Used the following link to setup a new Eclipse Java Project: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/
* Use the JavaFX and Eclipse Non-modular from IDE steps on said link
* I use the VM_Arguments.txt file to copy and paste the location of the JavaFX SDK on my computer into the Eclipse VM Arguments Run Configuration
